**About Me**
________________________________________

Hi,  
I'm Steven, a Computer Science and Mathematics major at Florida International University, graduating Spring 2027.  

I don’t currently specialize in one specific language, but I have experience working as a front-end engineer.  
Moving forward, I’m aiming to expand into **data science** and **data engineering**, as these are the fields that interest me most. I hope to work on projects that refine the skill set needed for these areas.
